# Single Page Site

## Installation
- ```npm install```

## Build CSS/JS
- ```npm run watch/prod```

## Description
This repo contains some starter tooling for a simple singe page site. The JS files in the JS folder will concatenate and/or Uglify (prod) automatically. The SCSS files in the SCSS folder will compile to CSS and have PostCSS applied (prod) automatically. The index.html file contains only the basic HTML to get started and pulls in the JS and CSS automatically.

## Instructions
Take some time to build a single page site or app of your choosing. You are encouraged to clone this repo and modify it as you see fit.  The app or site could be a resume or bio, a fun tool that displays something, or anything you may find interesting. Feel free to utilize a current technique, library, tool, or skill. Be as thorough as you want with formatting and comments. This is not a test of your design skills or creativity per se, but a glimpse into how you build a site or app.

## Rules
- The site needs to be able to run easily on a local environment. Please include instructions on how to build/run and access the site.
- Back-end scripting (node.js, php, etc) can be used, but again provide clear instructions.
- Please limit your time to a maximum of 15 hours. There is no minimum or maximum. I do not expect this to be a fully completed app or site, just a good effort.
